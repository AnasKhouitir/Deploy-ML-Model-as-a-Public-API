Diabetes Prediction with a Machine Learning Model Deployed as a Public API

In this project, I developed and deployed a Machine Learning model for diabetes prediction. The model was trained using a medical dataset and uses specific features to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes.

Key steps in the project include:

Preprocessing the data and training the model using Scikit-learn.
Saving the trained model for future use.
Building a RESTful API using FastAPI that allows users to send requests and receive predictions.
Deploying the API locally and exposing it to the public using ngrok, enabling easy access via a web URL.
This public API allows users to submit medical data and receive predictions, making the model accessible to a wide audience in a simple and efficient manner.
